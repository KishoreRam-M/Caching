### **1. Cache Expiration: TTL & TTI**  
Cache expiration ensures that stale data is removed from the cache, balancing freshness and performance. Ehcache provides two key expiration policies:  

- **Time-To-Live (TTL)**: The maximum time an entry can stay in the cache, regardless of access.  
  - Example: If TTL is **10 minutes**, the entry is removed after 10 minutes, even if itâ€™s frequently accessed.  
- **Time-To-Idle (TTI)**: The maximum time an entry can remain in the cache **without being accessed**.  
  - Example: If TTI is **5 minutes**, an entry will be removed if it hasn't been accessed in the last 5 minutes.  

ðŸ”¹ *Use Case:*  
TTL is useful for ensuring data freshness (e.g., session data), while TTI helps remove rarely used entries (e.g., user preference settings).

### **2. Size-Based Eviction Policies**  
When the cache reaches its size limit, Ehcache automatically evicts entries based on a chosen policy:  

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Removes the least recently accessed entry first.  
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Removes entries accessed the least over time.  
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Evicts the oldest cached entries first.  

ðŸ”¹ *Use Case:*  
- **LRU** works well when recent data is more relevant (e.g., caching search results).  
- **LFU** is better for keeping frequently accessed data (e.g., API response caching).  
- **FIFO** is useful when order matters (e.g., log event buffering).

### **3. Multi-Tiered Caching (Heap, Off-Heap, Disk)**  
Ehcache allows storing cached data across different memory tiers to balance speed and capacity:  

- **Heap Cache** (Fastest, but limited by JVM memory): Stores data in Javaâ€™s heap (RAM).  
- **Off-Heap Cache** (Outside JVM, but still in RAM): Uses native memory for larger capacity, preventing JVM garbage collection issues.  
- **Disk Cache** (Persistent but slower): Stores cached data on disk, surviving JVM restarts.  

ðŸ”¹ *Use Case:*  
- Heap caching is best for ultra-fast, in-memory operations.  
- Off-heap caching is useful for large caches without impacting JVM GC.  
- Disk caching is ideal for persisting data across restarts (e.g., session management).  

These features make Ehcache a powerful choice for handling various caching needs efficiently. ðŸš€
